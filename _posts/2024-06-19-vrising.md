# Hosting V Rising Server in Linux

Hello and welcome to the V Rising Server Guide on Linux using Docker. You will need to know how to use docker and port forwarding.

Firstly, create a new folder on your system.

```console
$ mkdir /opt/vrising
```

For me, I created a new folder in /opt/vrising.

For the docker file, I used TrueOsiris's docker-vrising guide.

In the vrising folder, create a new file named 'docker-compose.yml'.

```console
$ sudo nano docker-compose.yml
```

This will create a new docker-compose.yml. 

```yml
services:
  vrising:
    image: trueosiris/vrising
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/Paris
      - SERVERNAME=vrising-TrueOsiris
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: /your/host/vrising/server
        target: /mnt/vrising/server
        bind:
          create_host_path: true
      - type: bind
        source: /your/host/vrising/persistentdata
        target: /mnt/vrising/persistentdata
        bind:
          create_host_path: true
    ports:
      - '9876:9876/udp'
      - '9877:9877/udp'
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: bridge
```

Change the source: /your/host/ to your vrising folder.

Now enter the command below

```console
$ sudo docker compose up -d
```

Port Forward this on your router

```
'9876:9876/udp'
'9877:9877/udp'
```

When connecting to the server, use public ip:port.

Public ip can be found using [ipchicken](https://www.ipchicken.com/).

Well, thats the end of the guide. See ya.
